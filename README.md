# Voting-dApp-using-Ethereum-and-Solidity
The voting dApp will allow users to vote on a single question with two options: yes or no. Once the voting period is over, the results will be displayed for all to see.

Here are some features that the voting dApp could include:

- Setting the duration of the voting period
- Displaying the poll to potential voters
- Allowing users to cast their votes during the voting period
- Preventing users from voting after the voting period has ended
- Tallying the results and displaying them for all to see

The above mentioned functionalities are achieved through these steps.
