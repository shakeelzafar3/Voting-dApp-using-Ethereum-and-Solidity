## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a decentralized voting application (dApp) using Ethereum and Solidity.

## Objective
The objective of this tutorial is to provide a step-by-step guide to build a dApp that allows users to vote on a single question with two options (yes or no) on the Ethereum network. We will cover setting up a development environment, writing a smart contract for voting, building a web3 application to interact with the contract, deploying the dApp, and testing it. 

We will also cover following features of the dApp:
- Setting the duration of the voting period
- Displaying the poll to potential voters
- Allowing users to cast their votes during the voting period
- Preventing users from voting after the voting period has ended
- Tallying the results and displaying them for all to see

Let's jump into the basics of the environment and the prerequisites in the [next lesson](https://github.com/shakeelzafar3/Voting-dApp-using-Ethereum-and-Solidity/blob/main/2%20-%20About%20the%20tutorial.md).
