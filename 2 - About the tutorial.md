Let's have an overview of who should take this tutorial, the prerequisites for starting the tutorial, and the learning outcomes that participants can expect to achieve by the end of the tutorial.
## Who should take this tutorial?
This tutorial is ideal for beginners who are new to Ethereum and Solidity and want to learn how to build a simple dApp. It is also suitable for developers who want to gain a deeper understanding of how decentralized applications work on the Ethereum network. No prior experience with blockchain or smart contracts is necessary to follow along with this tutorial.
## Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts and familiarity with a programming language. You should also have a computer with an internet connection, a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Remix, and the ability to install software. Additionally, you will need a basic understanding of the Ethereum blockchain and how it works. If you are not familiar with these concepts, we recommend reviewing some introductory resources before continuing with this tutorial.
## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this tutorial, you will have:
- A good understanding of the Ethereum platform and its architecture.
- Knowledge of Solidity and how to write smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
- Knowledge of how to build a simple decentralized application using Ethereum and Solidity.
- The ability to set up a development environment for Ethereum and Solidity development.
- Knowledge of how to interact with a smart contract using web3.js.
- Knowledge of how to deploy a decentralized application on the Ethereum test network.
- The ability to test a decentralized application using Ganache and Metamask.
- An understanding of how to build decentralized applications that can be used for voting and other use cases.
